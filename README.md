# HYPEDROP.COM ACCOUNT CHECKER
----------------------------------

# Requirements
- latest version of python
- pip install requests
- pip install tls_client
- pip install random
- pip install urllib3
- nextcaptcha key: https://dashboard.nextcaptcha.com/auth


# Additional requirements
- Client didn't want to finish project which is why im releasing it. proxies.txt will not be used, you will need to manually set the proxy for each function or make a function which gets proxy from text file. Use chatgpt to make the function for you ig you don't know how to make the function.
- I would not recommend adding a ui and selling this lol. I would rewrite the application as a whole and probably use golang or something of the sorts to make it blazing fast.
